'''In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Examples
make_negative(1);  # return -1
make_negative(-5); # return -5
make_negative(0);  # return 0
Notes
The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.'''
